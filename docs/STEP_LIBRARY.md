# Step Library Reference Guide

## Introduction

This guide is designed for **Product Owners** and non-technical team members who want to write automated tests without coding.
The Hora Services QA Framework uses a **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)** approach where tests are written
in plain English using **Gherkin** syntax.

### What is This?

This document lists all available test steps (commands) you can use to build test scenarios.
Each step performs a specific action like clicking a button, filling a form field,
or checking if text appears on the screen.

### How to Use This Guide

1. **Find the step you need** in the tables below
2. **Copy the step pattern** into your feature file
3. **Replace the quoted text** with your actual values (e.g., replace `"buttonName"` with `"Save"`)
4. **Run your test** using `npm run test:smoke` or tag-based commands

### Three-Layer Architecture

Our framework uses a **3-layer step abstraction**:

- **Atomic Steps**: Low-level actions (click, fill, navigate) - **This guide focuses on these**
- **Domain Steps**: Business-specific workflows (create vehicle, assign driver)
- **Composite Steps**: Multi-step processes (complete vehicle onboarding)

## Step Categories

### 1. Navigation Steps

Navigate between pages and verify URLs.

| Step Pattern                         | Example                                               | Description                                     |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `Given Odoo is accessible at {url}`  | `Given Odoo is accessible at "http://localhost:8069"` | Verifies Odoo is running at specified URL       |
| `When I navigate to {pageKey} page`  | `When I navigate to "vehicles" page`                  | Navigates to a specific page using pageKey      |
| `Then I should be on {pageKey} page` | `Then I should be on "vehicles" page`                 | Verifies current page URL matches expected page |
| `When I go to {url}`                 | `When I go to "/web#model=fleet.vehicle"`             | Navigates to exact URL path                     |
| `When I refresh the page`            | `When I refresh the page`                             | Reloads the current page                        |

| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `Given I login with username {string} and password {string}` | `Given I login with username "admin" and password "admin"` | Logs into Odoo with credentials            |
| `Given I am logged in as admin`                              | `Given I am logged in as admin`                            | Quick login with default admin credentials |
| `When I logout`                                              | `When I logout`                                            | Logs out of current session                |

| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `Then database should contain vehicle plate {plate}`         | `Then database should contain vehicle plate "MD-TEST-001"`  | Verifies vehicle exists in DB  |
| `Then database should not contain vehicle plate {plate}`     | `Then database should not contain vehicle plate "MD-OLD"`   | Verifies vehicle doesn't exist |
| `Then database vehicle {plate} should have odometer {value}` | `Then database vehicle "MD-001" should have odometer 12500` | Verifies specific field value  |
| `Then driver {name} should exist in database`                | `Then driver "John Doe" should exist in database`           | Verifies driver record exists  |

## UI-MAP Keys Reference

The framework uses **UI-MAP pattern** to decouple tests from UI changes. Always use these keys instead of exact labels.

### Available Keys

**Page Keys** (for navigation):

```text
login, vehicles, vehicleForm, drivers, driverForm, dashboard, home
```

**Field Keys** (for form filling):

```text
licensePlate, model, modelName, vehicleType, driver, assignedDriver,
odometer, currentOdometer, acquisitionDate, immatriculation,
firstContractDate, vin, fuelType, color, seats, doors, brand,
horsepower, horsepowerTax, power, co2, category, tags,
driverName, driverPhone, driverMobile, driverEmail, driverCompany,
driverDepartment, login, email, password, name, description, notes
```

**Button Keys** (for clicking):

```text
create, new, save, edit, discard, discardChanges, delete, archive,
unarchive, duplicate, search, filter, groupBy, favorites, back,
cancel, close, confirm, ok, login, logout, print, export, import,
send, refresh, newRequest, assignDriver, unassignDriver, logOdometer
```

**Message Keys** (for assertions):

```text
vehicleSaved, driverAssigned, vehicleDeleted, loginSuccess,
loginFailed, validationError, accessDenied, recordCreated
```

## Tips for Writing Tests

### ✅ DO

- Use descriptive scenario names that explain the business value
- Tag scenarios appropriately (`@smoke`, `@critical`, `@api`, `@web`)
- Use Background section for common setup steps
- Clean up test data after scenarios
- Use meaningful test data (e.g., `MD-TEST-001`, not `XXX`)

### ❌ DON'T

- Hardcode exact UI labels (use UI-MAP keys instead)
- Create tests that depend on each other
- Skip assertions - always verify expected results
- Use production data in tests
- Create duplicate scenarios

### Example: BAD vs GOOD

**❌ BAD** (hardcoded labels, no assertions):

```gherkin
When I click "New" button
And I fill "License Plate" with "ABC"
And I click "Save" button
```

**✅ GOOD** (UI-MAP keys, clear assertions):

```gherkin
When I click "create" button
And I fill "licensePlate" with "MD-TEST-001"
And I click "save" button
Then I should see "Vehicles" text
And database should contain vehicle plate "MD-TEST-001"
```
