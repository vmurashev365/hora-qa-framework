## 🎯 What is this?

This framework automatically validates the Hora Services system:

- ✅ **Web Interface** — clicks, form filling, display verification
- ✅ **API** — server response validation without using the UI
- ✅ **Database** — verifies data is saved correctly
- ✅ **Security** — checks user access permissions
- ✅ **Performance** — validates system speed under load
- ✅ **Tablet Devices** — testing on Galaxy Tab and iPad

**Key Benefit:** Tests are written in plain English (Gherkin language), so business users can read
and even write tests without programming knowledge!

## 🚀 Quick Start (Step by Step)

## ⚡ 5-minute Demo

Goal: run a quick smoke suite and open an Allure report.

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
copy .env.example .env

# Optional (if you want a local Odoo + Postgres to test against)
npm run docker:start

# Run smoke
npm run test:smoke

# Generate + open Allure report (with trend history)
npm run report:allure:trend:open
```

Notes:

- Cucumber (`cucumber-js`) is the primary test runner in this repo.
- Playwright is used as the browser automation engine inside Cucumber steps.
- The Playwright Test runner (`npx playwright test`) is optional and not used by default.

### Step 1: Install Required Software

Before you begin, install these programs on your computer:

| Program | Why You Need It | How to Install |
| ------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| **Node.js 20+** | Runs the test framework | [Download from nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) — choose the LTS version |
| **Docker Desktop** | Runs the Odoo test environment | [Download from docker.com](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) |
| **Git** | Downloads the project code | [Download from git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) |

> 💡 **Tip:** After installing Docker Desktop, make sure it's running (the whale icon in your system tray should be active).

### Step 2: Download the Project

Open **PowerShell** (or **Terminal** on Mac) and run these commands:

```bash
# Navigate to where you want to store the project
cd C:\Projects

# Download the project
git clone https://github.com/hora-services/hora-qa-framework.git

# Go into the project folder
cd hora-qa-framework
```

> 💡 **How to open PowerShell:** Press `Win + X` and select "Windows PowerShell" or "Terminal".

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install project libraries (takes 1-2 minutes)
npm install

# Install the browser for testing
npx playwright install chromium

# Copy environment configuration (edit if needed)
copy .env.example .env   # Windows
# cp .env.example .env   # Mac/Linux
```

> ⏳ The first run may take several minutes — wait for it to complete.
>
> 💡 **Tip:** Review `.env` file and adjust settings if your Odoo runs on a different URL or port.

### Step 4: Start the Odoo Test Environment

```bash
# Start Odoo and PostgreSQL in Docker
npm run docker:start
```

**Wait for startup!** The first time, Odoo initialization may take **1-2 minutes**.

Verify it's ready:

1. Open your browser and go to <http://localhost:8069>
2. You should see the Odoo login page
3. Username: `admin`, Password: `admin`

> ⚠️ **If the page doesn't load:** Wait another minute and refresh. Check status with `docker-compose logs -f odoo`.

### Step 5: Run Your First Test

```bash
# Run quick smoke tests
npm run test:smoke
```

You'll see test progress and results:

- ✅ **Passed** — test completed successfully
- ❌ **Failed** — test found an issue

---

## 🧪 Running Tests

### Runner (important)

- **Primary runner:** Cucumber (`cucumber-js`) using config in `cucumber.js`.
- **Playwright usage:** Steps/hooks use the `playwright` library to drive browsers.
- **`@playwright/test` usage:** Used for Playwright's `expect` assertions inside Cucumber step definitions.
- **Playwright Test runner:** Optional only; see `playwright.config.ts`.

### Common Commands

| What to Test | Command | Duration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Quick check (smoke) | `npm run test:smoke` | ~2 min |
| API only | `npm run test:api` | ~3 min |
| Web UI only | `npm run test:web` | ~5 min |
| Integration tests | `npm run test:integration` | ~5 min |
| All tests | `npm run test:all` | ~15 min |
| Tablet tests | `npm run test:tablet` | ~3 min |

### Suites & tags

These suites map directly to `package.json` scripts and Cucumber tag expressions.

| Suite | Primary tags (present in `features/**/*.feature`) | Command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Smoke | `@smoke` (excludes `@api`) | `npm run test:smoke` |
| API | `@api` (excludes `@module_*` by default) | `npm run test:api` |
| API smoke | `@api-smoke` | `npm run test:api:smoke` |
| Web UI | `@web` (scoped to `features/web`) | `npm run test:web` |
| Integration | `@integration` (excludes `@module_*`) | `npm run test:integration` |
| Security | `@security` | `npm run test:security` |
| Accessibility | `@accessibility` | `npm run test:accessibility` |
| Tablet | `@tablet` (scoped to `features/mobile`) | `npm run test:tablet` |
| Tablet offline | `@tablet and @offline` | `npm run test:tablet:offline` |

Common secondary tags you can use to slice scenarios:

- `@critical`, `@quick-check`, `@galaxy-tab`, `@ipad-mini`, `@offline`

Module tags (use these to run specific functional areas):

- `@module_finance` (Financial Compliance)
- `@module_offline_sync` (Offline Sync)
- `@module_cti` (CTI Screen Pop)
- `@module_loads` (Loads / BOL upload flows)

Note: `npm run test:integration` excludes module-tagged scenarios by default.
Run module suites directly when the required external env/config is available.

Note: `npm run test:api` also excludes module-tagged scenarios by default.
For example, finance compliance API tests require `API_BASE_URL` and related vars.
Use the `test:module:*` scripts when the required external services and env vars are configured.

### Running Specific Tests

```bash
# By scenario name
npx cucumber-js --name "Access Vehicles page"

# By tag
npx cucumber-js --tags "@smoke"
npx cucumber-js --tags "@critical"
npx cucumber-js --tags "@tablet"
```

### Running with Visible Browser (for debugging)

By default, tests run in background mode (headless). To see what's happening:

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
$env:HEADLESS="false"; npm run test:smoke
```

**Mac/Linux:**

```bash
HEADLESS=false npm run test:smoke
```

---

## 📊 Viewing Reports

### Cucumber HTML Report (Simple)

After running tests, generate the report:

```bash
npm run report:cucumber
```

Open the file `reports/cucumber/index.html` in your browser.

### Allure Report (Advanced, with Charts)

```bash
# Generate report first, then open it
npm run report:allure
npm run report:allure:open

# Or use the combined command with history (recommended)
npm run report:allure:trend:open
```

> 💡 The Allure report will open automatically in your browser.

---

## 🤖 CI (GitHub Actions)

The workflow in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs:

- `npm ci`
- `npm run test:smoke`
- `npm run report:allure:trend`

Artifacts uploaded per run:

- `allure-results/` (raw results)
- `allure-report/` (generated HTML)
- `allure-history/` (trend history snapshot)

Note on trends: Allure trends require a previous run’s `allure-history`.
CI uploads it as an artifact so you can reuse it between runs (or wire a cache/pages flow later).

---

## 🖼️ Visual regression (POC)

This is a minimal visual regression proof-of-concept using Cucumber tag `@visual`.

1. Create/update baselines (local):

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
$env:UPDATE_BASELINE="1"; npm run test:visual
```

**Mac/Linux:**

```bash
UPDATE_BASELINE=1 npm run test:visual
```

Baselines are stored in `visual/baseline/`.

1. Compare against baselines (default):

```bash
npm run test:visual
```

On mismatch, the run writes debug images to `reports/visual/*.actual.png` and `reports/visual/*.diff.png`.

---

## 🧫 Test Data Strategy (Community Odoo)

This framework targets a **Community Odoo** environment and uses an
**environment-driven, strategy-based** approach for test data.

- Tests read credentials/URLs from environment variables (`.env` locally, CI secrets in pipelines).
- Data setup/cleanup should be **selectable per environment** (local docker vs shared QA vs CI)
  and **safe by default**.
- The scripts `npm run db:seed` and `npm run db:clean` are placeholders for the strategy layer;
  implementation and hardening come in Deliverable 2.

---

## 🔐 Secrets & environment variables

- Store secrets in environment variables (local `.env` file or CI secret store).
- Do **not** commit `.env` files; use `.env.example` as the template.
- CI should inject `ODOO_USERNAME`, `ODOO_PASSWORD`, DB credentials, etc. via repository/environment secrets.

### Error Screenshots

When a test fails, a screenshot is automatically saved in the folder:

```text
reports/screenshots/
```

This makes debugging much easier — you can see exactly what the screen looked like when the error occurred.

## 🚛 HOS/ELD Compliance Testing Architecture

The framework includes a **deterministic Hours-of-Service (HOS) compliance engine** for testing FMCSA regulations
without real-time waits or hardware ELD devices.

### VirtualClock — Deterministic Time Control

**Purpose:** Simulate hours/days instantly without `setTimeout` or real-time waits.

**Key Features:**

- ✅ Advance time by minutes: `clock.advanceMinutes(480)` → instantly jumps 8 hours ahead
- ✅ No flaky tests from real time delays
- ✅ Tests run in seconds instead of hours
- ✅ TypeScript type-safe with proper interface narrowing

**Example Usage:**

```typescript
// Create virtual clock starting at specific timestamp
const clock = new VirtualClock(Date.parse('2026-01-01T08:00:00Z'));

// Simulate 10 hours of driving instantly
await eldMock.simulateDriving('DRIVER-001', 600); // 600 minutes

// Clock automatically advances, HOS calculations update
```

**Recent Improvements:**

- Fixed TypeScript type narrowing for `advanceMinutes()` method (eliminated unsafe casts)
- Improved type safety with proper `TimeSource` interface checking

### EldMockClient — In-Memory ELD Simulator

**Purpose:** Mock Electronic Logging Device without hardware or cloud services.

**Capabilities:**

- Record duty status events (DRIVING, ON_DUTY, OFF_DUTY, SLEEPER_BERTH)
- Simulate driving/rest periods with VirtualClock integration
- Inject malfunctions for compliance testing
- Generate DOT inspection reports (USB format)
- Chronological validation (rejects out-of-order events)

### HosCalculator — FMCSA Rules Engine

**Purpose:** Pure calculation logic for Hours-of-Service compliance.

**Implements:**

- 11-hour driving limit
- 14-hour on-duty limit
- 70-hour/8-day limit
- 34-hour restart rules
- Break requirements

**Benefits:**

- ✅ Deterministic: same inputs = same outputs
- ✅ No side effects or external dependencies
- ✅ Easy to test and verify
- ✅ Portable to any project

### Testing HOS Compliance

**Feature File Example:**

```gherkin
@hos @compliance
Scenario: Driver exceeds 11-hour driving limit
  Given driver "D1" starts OFF_DUTY for 600 minutes
  When driver "D1" starts DRIVING for 660 minutes
  Then HOS service should report violation "DRIVING_LIMIT_EXCEEDED"
  And remaining drive time should be 0 minutes
```

**Behind the Scenes:**

1. VirtualClock advances 660 minutes instantly
2. EldMockClient records events with virtual timestamps
3. HosCalculator evaluates FMCSA rules
4. HosService returns violation status

**No real waits. No hardware. Fully deterministic.**

### Configuration

```bash
# .env settings for HOS/ELD
DEMO_MODE=true              # Enable demo/mock mode
ELD_MODE=mock               # Use EldMockClient (vs "api" for real hardware)
TIMEZONE=America/New_York   # IANA timezone for HOS calculations
HOS_RULESET=FMCSA          # Currently FMCSA only
```

## ✍️ Writing Tests

Tests are written in **Gherkin** — a simple English-like language that anyone can read and write!

### Example Test

```gherkin
@smoke
Feature: Vehicle Management
  As a fleet manager
  I want to see all vehicles
  So that I can manage my fleet

  Scenario: View the vehicles list
    Given Odoo is accessible at "http://localhost:8069"
    When I navigate to "Vehicles" page
    Then I should see "Vehicles" text
```

### Understanding the Format

| Part | What It Means |
| --- | --- |
| `@smoke` | Tag for grouping (you can run all @smoke tests together) |
| `Feature:` | The area being tested |
| `Scenario:` | One specific test case |
| `Given` | Setup / starting condition |
| `When` | Action you're testing |
| `Then` | Expected result |

### Common Test Steps (Quick Reference)

**Navigation:**

- `Given Odoo is accessible at "http://localhost:8069"` — verify system is up
- `When I navigate to "Vehicles" page` — go to a page
- `When I click "Create" button` — click a button

**Filling Forms:**

- `When I fill "Name" with "John Doe"` — enter text
- `When I select "Truck" from "Type" dropdown` — select from dropdown

**Checking Results:**

- `Then I should see "Success" text` — verify text is visible
- `Then I should see "Save" button` — verify button exists

### Markdown Linting

Markdown documentation follows strict style rules via [markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint).

**Check Markdown files:**

```bash
npx markdownlint-cli "**/*.md" --config .markdownlint.json
```

**Auto-fix Markdown issues:**

```bash
npx markdownlint-cli "**/*.md" --config .markdownlint.json --fix
```

**Configuration:**

- Config file: [.markdownlint.json](.markdownlint.json)
- Line length: 120 characters (MD013)
- Tables and code blocks excluded from line length checks
- Enforces blank lines around lists, headings, and fenced code blocks
- Requires language identifiers for code fences

**Common rules:**

- `MD031/MD032`: Blank lines around fences and lists
- `MD040`: Language specified for code blocks
- `MD013`: Line length limit
- `MD022`: Blank lines around headings

```

## 📝 Writing Tests

### Feature File Example

```gherkin
@smoke
Feature: My Feature
  As a user
  I want to do something
  So that I achieve a goal

  Scenario: My scenario
    Given Odoo is accessible at "http://localhost:8069"
    When I navigate to "Vehicles" page
    Then I should see "Vehicles" text
```

### Available Steps

**Navigation:**

- `Given Odoo is accessible at {string}`
- `When I navigate to {string} page`
- `When I click {string} link`
- `When I refresh the page`

**Interaction:**

- `When I click {string} button`
- `When I fill {string} with {string}`
- `When I select {string} from {string} dropdown`
- `When I check {string} checkbox`

**Assertions:**

- `Then I should see {string} text`
- `Then I should see {string} button`
- `Then {string} field should contain {string}`
- `Then I should be in form view`

## 🔍 Debugging

### Use Playwright Codegen

```bash
npx playwright codegen http://localhost:8069
```

### Run Single Scenario

```bash
npx cucumber-js --name "Access Vehicles page"
```

### Run with Tags

```bash
npx cucumber-js --tags "@critical"
npx cucumber-js --tags "@smoke and not @skip"
```

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### ❌ "Odoo not accessible" or page won't load

| Try This | How |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Check Docker is running | Look for the whale icon in your system tray |
| 2. Check containers are up | Run `docker-compose ps` — you should see "Up" status |
| 3. Wait longer | First startup can take 1-2 minutes |
| 4. Check logs | Run `docker-compose logs odoo` to see errors |
| 5. Restart Docker | Run `docker-compose down` then `npm run docker:start` |

### ❌ Tests failing — "element not found"

| Try This | How |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Run with visible browser | Use `$env:HEADLESS="false"; npm run test:smoke` |
| 2. Check element exists | Look at the page — is the button/field actually there? |
| 3. Update selectors | UI may have changed — run `npx playwright codegen http://localhost:8069` |

### ❌ "npm command not found"

Node.js may not be installed correctly:

1. Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Close and reopen PowerShell
3. Test with `node --version` — should show a version number

### ❌ TypeScript errors

```bash
npm run type-check
```

If you see errors, try:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

## 📊 Test Reports

Reports are automatically generated when you run tests:

| Report Type | Location | How to View |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Cucumber HTML** | `reports/cucumber/index.html` | Open file in browser |
| **Error screenshots** | `reports/screenshots/` | Open images to see failures |
| **Allure Report** | `allure-report/` | Run `npm run report:allure:open` |

### Recommended Workflow

```bash
# 1. Run your tests
npm run test:api

# 2. View the report with trend history
npm run report:allure:trend:open
```

The Allure report will open in your browser showing:

- Pass/fail summary
- Trend charts (if you have history)
- Detailed step-by-step execution
- Screenshots for failed tests

## 🏷 Test Tags Quick Reference

Use tags to run specific groups of tests:

| Tag | What It Runs | Command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@smoke` | Quick sanity checks | `npx cucumber-js --tags "@smoke"` |
| `@critical` | Business-critical paths | `npx cucumber-js --tags "@critical"` |
| `@api` | API tests only | `npx cucumber-js --tags "@api"` |
| `@tablet` | Tablet device tests | `npx cucumber-js --tags "@tablet"` |
| `@skip` | (Skips the test) | — |

**Combining tags:**

```bash
# Run smoke tests except skipped ones
npx cucumber-js --tags "@smoke and not @skip"

# Run either critical or smoke tests
npx cucumber-js --tags "@critical or @smoke"
```
